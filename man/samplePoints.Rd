\title{sample Points along the shoreline}
\usage{
samplePoints(
  Coastline = NA,
  ShorelinePointDist = 200,
  BufferDist = 300,
  RadLineDist = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Coastline}{Coastline LINESTRING of class sf and data.frame.}

\item{ShorelinePointDist}{Spacing between cross-shore profile lines (meters).
Note that it is recommended to keep this number as large as possible for
your area of interest to speed up processing time.}

\item{BufferDist}{Buffer search distance (meters) used to identify
the perpendicular angle of each cross-shore profile line from the coastline.}

\item{RadLineDist}{Numeric. Radial line distance (kilometers) of the cross-shore profiles. This value determines how for offshore (and onshore) the cross-shore profiles should extend (recommended values are 1 - 3 km).}
}
\value{
A list object of shoreline points and cross-shore profile lines
along the coastline.
}
\description{
Sample points along the coastline at specified intervals.
