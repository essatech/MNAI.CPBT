Description: Contains functions to model coastal wave attenuation,
    shoreline erosion and flooding. This package is an adaptation of the
    Natural Capital InVEST Wave Attenuation and Erosion Reduction ArcGIS
    Toolbox originally developed by Greg Guannel. Functions and workflows
    have been modified for evaluating municipal natural assets along
    coastlines in  Canada.
